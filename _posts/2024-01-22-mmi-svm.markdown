# The issue

After updating my MMI from the factory code to the latest provided, I noticed a new fault appearing under control module 5F (MMI). 

`B201A00 - Checking software version management`

While this doesn't seem to affect anything, it's not very nice to have faults logged. Initially I tried to clear the fault, but it returned immediately.

This appears to be a VAG feature called SVM (Software Version Management). The error can be cleared using VCDS or other tools by using the Adaptation feature.

### Using VCDS or any other tool to change your coding, or Adaptation values is **DANGEROUS**. If you make changes without full understanding, you can break your car. Don't do it!

# High level steps

1. Read 4 digit number from Adaptation channel IDE-02502 
2. Decrypt that value using the calculator above
3. Write the new value back to the same channel

The error will then be cleared. Note that if you re-read the Adaptation value, it won't have changed, this is normal.

The adaptation channel to use is IDE-02502-Confirmation of installation change. 

Here are some reference screenshots for the rest of the process:

For the technically inclined, the calculator above simply performs a bitwise XOR of the input against C9D2 which is the static key Audi use for this purpose.
