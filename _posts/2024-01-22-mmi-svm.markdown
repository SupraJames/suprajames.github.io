After updating my MMI from the factory code to the latest provided, I noticed a new fault appearing under control module 5F (MMI). 

`B201A00 - Checking software version management`

While this doesn't seem to affect anything, it's not very nice to have faults logged. Initially I tried to clear the fault, but it returned immediately.

This appears to be a VAG feature called SVM (Software Version Management). The error can be cleared using VCDS or other tools by using the Adaptation feature.

### Using VCDS or any other tool to change your coding, or Adaptation values is **DANGEROUS**. If you make changes without full understanding, you can break your car. Don't do it!

High level steps

1. Read 4 digit number from control module 
2. Decrypt that value using the calculator below
3. Write the new value back to the same channel

The error will then be cleared. Note that if you re-read the Adaptation value, it won't have changed, this is normal.

The adaptation channel to use is called "Confirmation of installation change", pictured here:

## Decryption tool

For the technically inclined, the calculator simply performs a bitwise XOR of the input against C9D2 which is the static key Audi use for this purpose.
